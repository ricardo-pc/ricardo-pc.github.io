I am a Graduate Student in Statistics at **UC Berkeley** with a background in large-scale data engineering and consulting.

Previously, I was a Senior Software Delivery Analyst at **McKinsey & Company** and a Consulting Analyst at **Deloitte**, where I built ETL pipelines handling hundreds of millions of rows, designed data warehouse architectures and extracted insights from data.

My focus is on the intersection of **robust data engineering** and **data science**. I enjoy building reproducible pipelines that enable advanced analytics.

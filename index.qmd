I’m a Statistics M.A. student at UC Berkeley preparing for a career in data science, focused on turning complex data into actionable insights.

I bring a strong data engineering background from McKinsey and Deloitte, where I built large-scale ETL pipelines and data warehouse architectures, and I now apply those skills to modeling, experimentation, and decision-focused analytics.

Current interests:

- Statistical modeling and causal inference
- ML for real-world decision-making
- Reproducible data pipelines for analytics at scale

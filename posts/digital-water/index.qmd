## Overview
**Atos IT Challenge 2020 — 2nd Place (First Mexican team in the competition's history)**

Digital Water is a cooperative-AI prototype built to help city utilities forecast water demand and available capacity. Using official data from Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey (SADM), we modeled daily demand and dam capacity to surface early warning signals for shortages.

## Context
This project focused on Monterrey, Mexico, my hometown. At the time, we did not realize the city was on the verge of a major water crisis that unfolded two years later. The work highlighted how proactive forecasting can shift utilities from reactive operations to preventative planning.

## Approach
We built an end-to-end Python workflow that:
1. Cleaned and aligned multi-source time-series data (consumption + dam capacity).
2. Trained two LSTM models to forecast daily demand and daily capacity.
3. Produced outputs that estimated "days-to-threshold" for safe levels.
4. Presented results via a web dashboard (hosted on Heroku at the time).

## Features
- Google Colab notebooks for both LSTM models
- Curated datasets with field dictionary
- Research summaries on Monterrey's water network
- Technical report and presentation materials
- Short demo video of the platform

## Results
- **2nd place among thousands of international teams** at Atos IT Challenge 2020.
- Presented to the Atos CEO and Scientific Board.

## Note
This solution was built between Nov 2019 and Jul 2020. The notebooks are kept as-is; today I would redesign the data engineering and modeling approach.

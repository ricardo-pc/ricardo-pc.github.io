## Overview
**Atos IT Challenge 2020 - 2nd Place Winner**

For the Atos IT Challenge, our team developed a machine learning prototype designed to help city utility managers forecast water demand and prevent shortages. The system analyzed network data to estimate "days-to-threshold" for safe water levels.

## The Problem
City water networks struggle with efficiency. Leaks and unpredicted demand spikes can lead to critical shortages. Our goal was to move from reactive maintenance to proactive forecasting.

## The Solution
We built an end-to-end Python pipeline that:
1.  Ingested historical consumption data.
2.  Cleaned and aggregated time-series data.
3.  Trained a forecasting model (using libraries like Scikit-Learn/Statsmodels).
4.  Visualized the "Days to Critical Threshold" on a dashboard.

### Key Technologies
*   **Python:** Core logic and data processing.
*   **Pandas/NumPy:** Time-series manipulation.
*   **Scikit-Learn:** Model training.

## Results
*   Placed **2nd among hundreds of international teams**.
*   Presented the solution directly to the CEO of Atos and the Scientific Board.

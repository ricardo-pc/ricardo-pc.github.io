## The Story at a Glance

In 2020, our team built an AI system to forecast water demand for my hometown of Monterrey, Mexico. We won **2nd place globally** at the Atos IT Challenge, the first Mexican team ever to achieve this distinction in the competition's 10-year history.

Two years later, our predictions came true. Monterrey plunged into a severe water crisis, forcing 5 million residents to survive on minimal daily water allocations for nearly two years.
:::

## What If You Could See a Crisis Coming?

Between November 2019 and July 2020, my team developed Digital Water, a machine learning platform to forecast water demand and capacity at the city level. Working with real data from Monterrey's official water utility (SADM), we built LSTM neural networks that could predict daily water consumption and available dam capacity.

At the time, we were focused on winning an international competition. We didn't realize we were documenting the early warning signs of a catastrophe.

## The Challenge

Monterrey is Mexico's third-largest metro area and a major industrial hub. The city's water system serves over 5 million people, drawing from a network of dams and underground sources. But water scarcity was becoming more frequent, and utilities were operating reactively, responding to shortages rather than preventing them.

Our goal: Build a forecasting system that could shift water management from reactive to preventative, giving utilities early warning signals before reaching critical thresholds.

## Our Solution

We developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

### Data Engineering
- Collected and cleaned multi-source time-series data from SADM
- Aligned daily consumption records with dam capacity measurements
- Created comprehensive field dictionaries and documentation

### Predictive Models
- Trained two LSTM neural networks (one for demand, one for capacity)
- Forecasted daily water demand and available capacity
- Calculated "days-to-threshold" estimates for safe operating levels
- Implemented in Python using TensorFlow

### Deployment
- Built an interactive web dashboard (hosted on Heroku)
- Created Google Colab notebooks for accessibility and reproducibility
- Produced technical documentation and presentation materials

## What Happened Next: The Crisis

In 2022, everything our models predicted came to pass.

Monterrey experienced a devastating water crisis that lasted nearly two years. The city's 5 million residents were reduced to minimal daily water allocations. Neighborhoods received water only a few hours per week. Businesses struggled. The crisis validated our forecasting approach—but also showed the human cost of delayed action.

## Timeline

**2019-2020:** Built forecasting models with SADM data

**July 2020:** Won 2nd place at Atos IT Challenge

**2022:** Water crisis begins—predictions validated

**2022-2024:** Nearly two years of severe rationing for 5M residents

**2024:** Crisis subsides
:::

The crisis highlighted how proactive forecasting can shift utilities from reactive operations to preventative planning—and why such systems need to be deployed, not just built.

## Technical Details

For those interested in the implementation:

- **Models:** Two LSTM neural networks (demand + capacity forecasting)
- **Data:** Official records from Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey (SADM)
- **Features:** Multi-variate time series including consumption patterns, dam levels, and seasonal factors
- **Outputs:** Daily forecasts + "days-to-threshold" risk estimates
- **Code:** Open-source notebooks in Google Colab
- **Documentation:** Complete technical report and research summaries

## Reflection

This project was completed in 2020, and the notebooks remain as-is in the repository. **Looking back (5 years later) with more experience in ML, I would redesign the data pipeline, modeling aproach, stability and predictability of the model and scalability.** But the core lesson remains: predictive models only create impact when they're deployed and acted upon.

The crisis our system forecasted was preventable. The data was there. The models worked. What was missing was the infrastructure and institutional will to act on early warnings.

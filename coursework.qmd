## UC Berkeley M.A. in Statistics

Coursework highlights the tools and theory I use for data science, with an emphasis on modeling, decision-making, and scalable computation.

### In Progress (Current Term)
- STAT 214 — Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Real-World Decision Making: applied ML and decision-focused modeling.
- STAT 230A — Linear Models: regression, GLMs, diagnostics, and inference.
- STAT 254 — Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning: generalization, optimization, and modern ML methods.
- COMPSCI 289A — Introduction to Machine Learning: core ML theory and algorithms.
- STAT 238 — Bayesian Statistics: hierarchical models, priors, and MCMC.

### Completed
- STAT 201A — Advanced Probability
- STAT 201B — Advanced Statistics
- STAT 243 — Statistical Computing: projects and programming-focused assignments.

    "text": "Approach\nWe built an end-to-end Python workflow that: 1. Cleaned and aligned multi-source time-series data (consumption + dam capacity). 2. Trained two LSTM models to forecast daily demand and daily capacity. 3. Produced outputs that estimated “days-to-threshold” for safe levels. 4. Presented results via a web dashboard (hosted on Heroku at the time)."

I enjoy building reproducible pipelines that enable advanced analytics."

Trained a forecasting model (using libraries like Scikit-Learn/Statsmodels). 4. Visualized the “Days to Critical Threshold” on a dashboard.\n\nKey Technologies\n\nPython: Core logic and data processing.\nPandas/NumPy: Time-series manipulation.\nScikit-Learn: Model training."
